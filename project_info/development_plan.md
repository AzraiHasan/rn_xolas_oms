# Strategic Development Roadmap: Onsite Reporting App Prototype

## Executive Overview

This development roadmap provides a strategic framework for progressively delivering the Onsite Reporting App prototype while optimizing resource utilization and maximizing value creation. By structuring our approach through methodically sequenced epics and sprints, we create a value delivery pipeline that aligns technological implementation with core business objectives.

The roadmap follows a UI-first development philosophy, enabling rapid stakeholder visualization and validation of the user experience before allocating resources to complex backend logic. This approach accelerates feedback cycles, mitigates implementation risk, and establishes a foundation for agile adaptation as requirements evolve.
