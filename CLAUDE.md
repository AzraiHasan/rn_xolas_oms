# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Xolas OMS** (v0.0.1) - an onsite reporting app prototype built with React Native/Expo for field technicians to create issue reports with photo attachments. 

**Branch: feature/supabase-integration** - Supabase integration Phase 3 complete! Report sync and photo sync fully working on all platforms (web ‚úÖ, native ‚úÖ). Ready for Phase 4 (Multi-Device Testing).

## Current Implementation State

**Status**: Phase 3 Complete ‚úÖ - Cross-platform sync fully operational on all platforms
**Data Flow**: UI ‚Üí IssueContext ‚Üí IssueRepository ‚Üí StorageService (Local + Supabase sync)
**Report Sync**: ‚úÖ Fully working - local to Supabase database sync operational on all platforms (native, web)
**Photo Sync**: ‚úÖ Fully working - Both web and native platforms operational with Supabase Storage
**Current Phase**: Ready for Phase 4 (Multi-Device Testing)

## Development Commands

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm install @supabase/supabase-js` - Install Supabase client (for this branch)
- `npx expo start` - Start development server
- `npm run android` - Run on Android device/emulator
- `npm run ios` - Run on iOS device/simulator  
- `npm run web` - Run web version
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks
- `npm run reset-project` - Reset to blank project

## Branch Context

**Working POC**: Switch to `alpha-dev` branch for stable demo version
**Supabase Integration**: Stay on this branch for backend integration work

## Architecture

### Core Services Architecture (Phase 2 Complete)
- **IssueContext** - ‚úÖ Global state management using React Context
- **IssueRepository** - ‚úÖ Abstraction layer with local + Supabase sync
- **StorageService** - ‚úÖ Hybrid: AsyncStorage + ExpoFileSystem + Supabase sync
- **SyncService** - ‚úÖ Supabase backend integration operational (reports sync working)
- **SupabaseService** - ‚úÖ Database operations implemented and working

### Current Storage Strategy (Hybrid Architecture)
- **Issues**: Local AsyncStorage + Supabase database sync (‚úÖ working on all platforms)
- **Photos**: Local file system + Supabase Storage (‚úÖ working on all platforms)
- **Sync Status**: Device-based sync_status tracking ('pending'/'synced')
- **Device Isolation**: UUID-based device_id for multi-device support
- **Network**: @react-native-community/netinfo triggering auto-sync
- **Platform Compatibility**: Web compatibility added with localStorage and platform-specific storage adapters

### Database Schema (Implemented - Phase 1 Complete)
```sql
-- Current working schema (Phase 1)
reports (id, device_id, title, description, severity, status, sync_status, created_at, metadata)
photos (id, report_id, storage_path, thumbnail_path, metadata)
sync_logs (id, device_id, operation, status, timestamp)

-- Future expansion tables (planned)
organizations (id, name, settings)
sites (id, organization_id, name, location, metadata)
teams (id, site_id, name)
users (id, team_id, name, role, permissions)
```

### UI Framework
- **NativeWind** for Tailwind CSS styling
- **Expo Router** with file-based routing (`app/` directory)
- **Tab navigation** as primary navigation pattern

### Navigation Structure
```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (tabs)/          # Tab-based navigation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx    # Dashboard/Home
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ issues.tsx   # Issue list
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ create-issue.tsx # Issue creation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ issue/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [id].tsx     # Issue detail view
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ update/[id].tsx # Issue editing
```

### Component Organization
- `components/ui/` - Reusable UI components with NativeWind styling
- `components/issues/` - Issue-specific components
- `components/photos/` - Camera and photo handling components
- `components/forms/` - Form field components

### Type System
- Path aliases: `@/*` maps to project root
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Centralized types in `types/models/` and `types/services/`

### Photo Management (Implemented)
- ‚úÖ Camera integration via `expo-camera` v16.1.6
- ‚úÖ Gallery access via `expo-image-picker` v16.1.4  
- ‚úÖ Local file storage via ExpoFileSystemService in document directory
- ‚úÖ Image optimization via `expo-image-manipulator` with smart compression (200KB threshold)
- ‚úÖ Automatic resizing (max 1200px width) and JPEG quality control (70-80%)
- ‚ùå Thumbnail generation not implemented (full-size only)

### Offline-First Design (Hybrid - Phase 2 Complete)
- ‚úÖ **Primary**: Local-first with AsyncStorage + FileSystem for immediate operations
- ‚úÖ **Background Sync**: Automatic sync to Supabase when network available
- ‚úÖ **Network Awareness**: `@react-native-community/netinfo` triggering auto-sync  
- ‚úÖ **Device Isolation**: UUID-based device_id for multi-device data separation
- ‚úÖ **Sync Status Tracking**: 'pending'/'synced' status per report
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Web and native storage adapters with platform detection
- ‚úÖ **Photo Sync**: Both web and native platforms operational with Supabase Storage
